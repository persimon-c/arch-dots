Configuring Advanced and Cool Devices 

Devices 

Note 

Looking for the old hyprlang syntax? Check the 0.54 wiki pages. Since Hyprland 0.55, hyprlang is deprecated in favor of lua. 

For global device configs, check the Variables page. This page will focus on per-device configs. A basic per-device config is done via the hl.device() fn: 

hl.device({ 

name **\=** "my-epic-keyboard", 

sensitivity **\= \-**0.5 

})

The name can be easily obtained by checking the output of hyprctl devices . 

Inside of it, put your config options. All options from the input category (and all subcategories, e.g. input.touchpad ) can be put inside, EXCEPT: 

force\_no\_accel 

Options that configure window management, such as: follow\_mouse , follow\_mouse\_threshold , float\_switch\_override\_focus , mouse\_refocus , special\_fallthrough , etc. 

You can also use the output setting for tablets to bind them to outputs. Remember to use the name of the Tablet and not Tablet Pad or Tablet Tool . 

Additional properties only present in per-device configs: 

enabled \-\> (only for mice / touchpads / touchdevices / keyboards) 

enables / disables the device (connects / disconnects from the on-screen cursor) 

default: Enabled 

keybinds \-\> (only for devices that send key events) 

enables / disables keybinds for the device 

default: Enabled 

tags \-\> (only for keyboards / pointers) 

provides grouping and alt-names is device specific binds (see Per-Device Binds). comma separated list of tags 

default: "" 

Note 

Per-device layouts will by default not alter the keybind keymap, so for example with a global keymap of us and a per-device one of fr , the keybinds will still act as if you were on us . 

You can change this behavior by setting resolve\_binds\_by\_sym \= 1 . In that case you’ll need to type the symbol specified in the bind to activate it.
