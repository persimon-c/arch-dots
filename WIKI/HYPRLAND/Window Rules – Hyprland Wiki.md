Configuring Basics Window Rules 

Window Rules 

Note 

Looking for the old hyprlang syntax? Check the 0.54 wiki pages. Since Hyprland 0.55, hyprlang is deprecated in favor of lua. 

Warning 

Rules are evaluated top to bottom, so the order they’re written in does matter\! More info in Notes 

Window Rules 

You can set window rules to achieve different window behaviors based on their properties. Syntax 

Basic named rule syntax: 

hl.window\_rule({ 

name **\=** "apply-something", 

match **\=** { 

class **\=** "my-window" 

}, 

border\_size **\=** 10 

}) 

Basic anonymous rule syntax: 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "my-window" }, border\_size **\=** 10 })

Rules are split into two categories of parameters: props and effects. Props are the fields inside the match table, which are used to determine if a window should get the rule. Effects are what is applied. 

All props must match for a rule to be applied. 

You can have as many props and effects per rule as you please, in any order as you please, as long as: 

there is only one of one type (e.g. specifying match.class twice is invalid) 

there is at least one prop 

Props 

The supported fields for the match table are: 

| Field  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| class  | \[RegEx\]  | Windows with class matching RegEx . |
| title  | \[RegEx\]  | Windows with title matching RegEx . |
| initial\_class  | \[RegEx\]  | Windows with initialClass matching RegEx . |
| initial\_title  | \[RegEx\]  | Windows with initialTitle matching RegEx . |
| tag  | \[name\]  | Windows with matching tag . |

| Field  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| xwayland  | \[bool\]  | Xwayland windows. |
| float  | \[bool\]  | Floating windows. |
| fullscreen  | \[bool\]  | Fullscreen windows. |
| pin  | \[bool\]  | Pinned windows. |
| focus  | \[bool\]  | Currently focused window. |
| group  | \[bool\]  | Grouped windows. |
| modal  | \[bool\]  | Modal windows (e.g. “Are you sure” popups) |
| fullscreen\_state\_client  | \[int\] | Windows with matching fullscreenstate . 0 \- none, 1 \- maximize, 2 \- fullscreen, 3 \- maximize and fullscreen. |
| fullscreen\_state\_internal  | \[int\] | Windows with matching fullscreenstate . 0 \- none, 1 \- maximize, 2 \- fullscreen, 3 \- maximize and fullscreen. |
| workspace  | \[workspace\] | Windows on matching workspace. Can be id , "name:string" or a workspace selector. |
| content  | \[string\]  | Windows with specified content type (none, photo, video, game). |
| xdg\_tag  | \[RegEx\]  | Match a window by its xdgTag (see hyprctl clients to check if it has one). |

Keep in mind that you have to declare at least one field, but not all. 

Note 

To get more information about a window’s class, title, XWayland status or its size, you can use hyprctl clients . 

Note 

In the output of the hyprctl clients command: fullscreen refers to fullscreen\_state\_internal and fullscreenClient refers to fullscreen\_state\_client 

RegEx writing 

Please note Hyprland uses Google’s RE2 for parsing RegEx. This means that all operations requiring polynomial time to compute will not work. See the RE2 wiki for supported extensions. 

If you want to negate a RegEx, as in pass only when the RegEx fails, you can prefix it with negative: , e.g.: "negative:kitty" . 

Effects 

Static effects 

Static effects are evaluated once when the window is opened and never again. This essentially means that it is always the initialTitle and initialClass which will be found when matching on title and class , respectively. 

Warning 

It is not possible to float (or any other static rule) a window based on a change in the title after the window has been created. This applies to all static effects listed here.

| Effect  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| float  | boolean  | Floats a window. |
| tile  | boolean  | Tiles a window. |
| fullscreen  | boolean  | Fullscreens a window. |
| maximize  | boolean  | Maximizes a window. |
| fullscreen\_state  | string | Sets the fullscreen mode, e.g. "1 2" (internal client). Values: 0 none, 1 maximize, 2 fullscreen, 3 maximize and fullscreen. |
| move  | string | Moves a floating window to a given coordinate, monitor-local. E.g. {100, 200} or {"cursor\_x-(window\_w\*0.5))", "(cursor\_y-(window\_h\*0.5))"} . |
| size  | string | Resizes a floating window. E.g. {800, 600} or {"(monitor\_w\*0.5)", " (monitor\_h\*0.5)"} . |
| center  | boolean  | If the window is floating, will center it on the monitor. |
| pseudo  | boolean  | Pseudotiles a window. |
| monitor  | string | Sets the monitor on which a window should open. E.g. "1" or "DP-1" . Can be suffixed with " silent" |
| workspace  | string | Sets the workspace on which a window should open. Can also be "unset" or suffixed with " silent" . |
| no\_initial\_focus  | boolean  | Disables the initial focus to the window. |
| pin  | boolean  | Pins the window (i.e. show it on all workspaces). Note: floating only. |
| group  | string  | Sets window group properties. See group options below. |
| suppress\_event  | string | Ignores specific events. Space-separated: "fullscreen" , "maximize" , "activate" , "activatefocus" , "fullscreenoutput" . |
| content  | string  | Sets content type: "none" , "photo" , "video" , or "game" . |
| no\_close\_for  | integer  | Makes the window uncloseable with killactive for a given number of ms on open. |
| scrolling\_width  | number  | Set column width for window when starting on a workspace with the scrolling layout. |

Expressions 

Expressions are used with move and size . They are space-separated (no spaces within each expression). All position variables are monitor-local. 

monitor\_w and monitor\_h for monitor size 

window\_x and window\_y for window position 

window\_w and window\_h for window size 

cursor\_x and cursor\_y for cursor position 

Example expressions: 

move **\=** {"window\_w \* 0.5", "(monitor\_h / 2\) \+ 17"} 

size **\=** {"monitor\_w \* 0.5", "monitor\_h \* 0.5"}

Dynamic effects 

Dynamic effects are re-evaluated every time a property changes. 

| Effect  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| persistent\_size  | boolean | For floating windows, internally store their size. When a new floating window opens with the same class and title, restore the saved size. |
| no\_max\_size  | boolean  | Removes max size limitations. |
| stay\_focused  | boolean  | Forces focus on the window as long as it’s visible. |

| Effect  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| animation  | string | Forces an animation onto a window with an optional style. E.g. "popin" or "popin 80%" . |
| border\_color  | gradient | Force the border color. Accepts a color, gradient, or two gradients (active/inactive). E.g. "rgb(FF0000)" or { colors \= {"rgba(33ccffee)", "rgba(00ff99ee)"}, angle \= 45 } . |
| idle\_inhibit  | string  | Sets an idle inhibit rule. Modes: "none" , "always" , "focus" , "fullscreen" . |
| opacity  | string | Additional opacity multiplier. E.g. "0.8" (overall), "0.9 0.7" (active/inactive), "1.0 0.8 0.9" (active/inactive/fullscreen). Append " override" after each value to set absolute instead of multiplied. |
| tag  | string  | Applies a tag. Use prefix \+ / \- to set/unset, or no prefix to toggle. E.g. "+myTag" . |
| max\_size  | vec2  | Sets the maximum size for floating windows. E.g. { 800, 600 } . |
| min\_size  | vec2  | Sets the minimum size for floating windows. E.g. { 200, 150 } . |

| no\_shadow  | boolean  | Disables shadows for the window. |
| no\_shortcuts\_inhibit  | boolean  | Disallows the app from inhibiting your shortcuts. |
| no\_screen\_share  | boolean | Hides the window and its popups from screen sharing by drawing black rectangles in their place. |
| no\_vrr  | boolean  | Disables VRR for the window. Only works when misc.vrr is set to 2 or 3 . |
| no\_auto\_hdr  | boolean | Disables AutoHDR for the window. This is useful to stop programs like foot triggering AutoHDR when they are fullscreened. |
| opaque  | boolean  | Forces the window to be opaque. |
| force\_rgbx  | boolean  | Forces Hyprland to ignore the alpha channel entirely. |
| sync\_fullscreen  | boolean | Whether the fullscreen mode should always be the same as the one sent to the window. |

| confine\_pointer  | boolean | Locks the mouse cursor to the window. Mostly useful for keeping your mouse cursor locked to one monitor during gaming. |

All dynamic effects can be set with setprop . 

**group** window rule options 

The group effect takes a string with space-separated options: 

"set" \[ "always" \] \- Open window as a group. 

"new" \- Shorthand for "barred set" . 

"lock" \[ "always" \] \- Lock the group. Combine with "set" or "new" . 

"barred" \- Do not automatically group into the focused unlocked group. 

"deny" \- Do not allow the window to be toggled as or added to a group. 

"invade" \- Force open window in the locked group. 

"override" \[other options\] \- Override other group rules. 

"unset" \- Clear all group rules. 

Note 

group with no options is a shorthand for group \= "set" . 

By default, set and lock only affect new windows once. The always qualifier makes them always effective. 

Tags 

Window tags can be static or dynamic. Dynamic tags have a suffix of \* . Check window tags with hyprctl clients . 

Use the tagwindow dispatcher to add a static tag to a window: 

hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag \= "+code" })' \# Add tag to current window. hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag \= "-code" })' \# Remove tag from current window. hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag \= "code" })' \# Toggle the tag of current window. 

\# Or target windows: 

hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag \= "+music", window \= "class:Celluloid" })' Use the tag effect to add a dynamic tag to a window: 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "footclient" }, tag **\=** "+term" }) \-- Add dynamic tag \`term\*\` hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "footclient" }, tag **\=** "term" }) \-- Toggle dynamic tag \`term\*\` hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "cpp" }, tag **\=** "+code" }) \-- Add \`code\*\` to windows tagged \`c hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "code" }, opacity **\=** "0.8" }) \-- Set opacity for tag \`code\` or \`c hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "cpp" }, opacity **\=** "0.7" }) \-- \`cpp\`-tagged windows match both; hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "term\*" }, opacity **\=** "0.6" }) \-- Match \`term\*\` only, not bare \`te hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "term" }, tag **\=** "-code" }) \-- Remove dynamic tag \`code\*\` from 

Or with a keybind for convenience: 

hl.bind("SUPER \+ CTRL \+ 2", hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag **\=** "alpha\_0.2" })) 

hl.bind("SUPER \+ CTRL \+ 4", hl.dsp.window.tag({ tag **\=** "alpha\_0.4" })) 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "alpha\_0.2" }, opacity **\=** "0.2 override" }) 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { tag **\=** "alpha\_0.4" }, opacity **\=** "0.4 override" })

The tag effect can only manipulate dynamic tags, and the tagwindow dispatcher only works with static tags (dynamic tags are cleared when the dispatcher is called). 

Example Rules   
\-- Move kitty to 100 100 and add an anim style (named rule) 

hl.window\_rule({ 

name **\=** "move-kitty", 

match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, 

move **\=** {100, 100}, 

animation **\=** "popin", 

}) 

\-- Disable blur for firefox 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "firefox" }, no\_blur **\= true** }) 

\-- Move kitty to the center of the cursor 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, 

move **\=** {"cursor\_x-(window\_w\*0.5)", "cursor\_y-(window\_h\*0.5)"}, 

}) 

\-- Set border color to red if window is fullscreen 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { fullscreen **\= true** }, 

border\_color **\=** "rgb(FF0000) rgb(880808)", 

}) 

\-- Set border color to yellow when title contains Hyprland 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { title **\=** ".\*Hyprland.\*" }, 

border\_color **\=** "rgb(FFFF00)", 

}) 

\-- Set opacity to 1.0 active, 0.5 inactive and 0.8 fullscreen for kitty 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, 

opacity **\=** "1.0 override 0.5 override 0.8 override", 

}) 

\-- Set rounding to 10 for kitty 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, rounding **\=** 10 }) 

\-- Fix pinentry losing focus 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { class **\=** "(pinentry-)(.\*)" }, 

stay\_focused **\= true**, 

}) 

Notes 

Effects marked as Dynamic are reevaluated whenever the matching property of the window changes. For instance, if a rule changes the border\_color when a window is floating, the color reverts to default when it’s tiled again. 

Effects are processed top to bottom \- the last match takes precedence: 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, opacity **\=** "0.8 0.8" }) 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { float **\= true** }, opacity **\=** "0.5 0.5" }) 

Here, all non-fullscreen kitty windows have opacity 0.8 , except when floating \- those get 0.5 . All other floating windows get 0.5 . 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { float **\= true** }, opacity **\=** "0.5 0.5" }) 

hl.window\_rule({ match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, opacity **\=** "0.8 0.8" })

Here, all kitty windows get opacity 0.8 , even if floating. Other floating windows get 0.5 . 

Important 

Named rules take precedence over anonymous ones. Rules are evaluated top to bottom, but all named rules are evaluated first, then all anonymous ones.   
Note 

Opacity is a PRODUCT of all opacities by default. For example, setting active\_opacity to 0.5 and opacity to 0.5 results in a total of 0.25 . Opacities over 1.0 are allowed, but any product over 1.0 will cause graphical glitches. 

Use " override" after an opacity value to set it as an exact value rather than a multiplier: 

\-- Active 0.8, inactive 0.8, fullscreen 1.0 regardless of other rules: 

hl.window\_rule({ 

match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, 

opacity **\=** "0.8 override 0.8 override 1.0 override", 

}) 

Dynamically enabling / disabling / changing rules 

Only named rules can be dynamically changed, enabled, or disabled. hl.window\_rule() returns a handle object: 

**local** myRule **\=** hl.window\_rule({ 

name **\=** "my-rule", 

match **\=** { class **\=** "kitty" }, 

border\_size **\=** 5, 

}) 

myRule:set\_enabled(**false**) \-- disable 

myRule:set\_enabled(**true**) \-- re-enable 

myRule:is\_enabled() \-- query status

Layer Rules 

Some things in Wayland are not windows, but layers \- app launchers, status bars, wallpapers, etc. These have separate rules using hl.layer\_rule() . The syntax is the same as hl.window\_rule() . 

Props 

| Field  | Argument  | Description |
| ----: | ----- | :---: |
| namespace  | \[RegEx\]  | Namespace of the layer. Check hyprctl layers . |

Effects 

| Effect  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| no\_anim  | boolean  | Disables animations. |
| blur  | boolean  | Enables blur for the layer. |
| blur\_popups  | boolean  | Enables blur for popups. |
| ignore\_alpha  | number  | Makes blur ignore pixels with opacity of a or lower. Float from 0 to 1 . |
| dim\_around  | boolean  | Dims everything behind the layer. |
| xray  | boolean  | Sets the blur xray mode for the layer. |
| animation  | string  | Sets a specific animation style for this layer. |
| order  | integer | Sets the order relative to other layers. Higher n \= closer to edge of monitor. Can be negative. |
| above\_lock  | integer  | If non-zero, renders the layer above the lockscreen. 2 \= interactive on lockscreen. |

| Effect  | Argument  | Description |
| ----- | :---: | ----- |

hl.layer\_rule({ match **\=** { namespace **\=** "waybar" }, blur **\= true** }) 

\-- Named layer rule 

**local** selectionRule **\=** hl.layer\_rule({ 

name **\=** "no-anim-for-selection", 

match **\=** { namespace **\=** "selection" }, 

no\_anim **\= true**, 

}) 

\-- Enable blur and ignore\_alpha for rofi 

hl.layer\_rule({ 

match **\=** { namespace **\=** "rofi" }, 

blur **\= true**, 

ignore\_alpha **\=** 0.5, 

}) 

Layer rules also return a handle with set\_enabled() / is\_enabled() : 

**local** myLayerRule **\=** hl.layer\_rule({ 

name **\=** "my-layer-rule", 

match **\=** { namespace **\=** "waybar" }, 

blur **\= true**, 

}) 

myLayerRule:set\_enabled(**false**)
